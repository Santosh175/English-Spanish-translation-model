## ✨ Features

- 🌐 **Seamless Translation**: Converts English sentences into Spanish.
- 🧠 **Advanced Architecture**: Utilizes an Encoder-Decoder network for accurate translations.
- 🖥️ **Fully Integrated**: Built with Django for a smooth, fully functional web app experience.
- 🔄 **LSTM Model**: Currently using LSTM, with plans to upgrade to an Attention model soon.
- **No External APIs**: Achieved translation without relying on any external language translation APIs. 💡

## ❓ Why English to Spanish?

The availability and accuracy of English-to-Spanish datasets made it an ideal starting point. But don’t worry, support for other languages, including Hindi, is on the way! 🇮🇳
